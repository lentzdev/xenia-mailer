Xenia Mailer/Edit - log of added/changed/fixed stuff

Please note that this is NOT a complete list of changes.
Many minor things and even some major things don't get in here.
Also, it doesn't say anything about what I'm currently working on.
So don't assume too much (if anything) based on this list!


1.99.01 (OpenSource release) April/May 2001 ===================================
 - After changing work, getting engaged/married, migrating to Australia....
   You get the idea, all this took a while - life happens ;)
 - Sorting out the various bits making it workable for others
 - For XENIA project on SourceForge (sourceforge.net), see README.AGL file
 * It'd be good if someone would keep this log upto date if stuff is done ;)

1.99.00 (OpenSource preparations) 1999 ========================================

 - Because I removed the key code, Xenia now always assumes it is multiline:
   1. Now you always have to specify a commandline or config option "TASK <n>".
   2. Before, it used to delete XMRESCAN.FLG at some points if 'Single Task'.
      This made a single Xenia always do a rescan after starting, packing, etc.
      Now, it doesn't.
      If you saw Xenia 1.98.xx report itself with (Single) or (Single Task),
      check your mail process handling and touch the flag yourself if needed.
      (Yeah touch, not delete. That's cleaner.)
   3. "MAILER NO-DIRSCAN" cfg-option checked & refused if single-task.
      So NOW you can shoot yourself in the foot ;-)
   4. At some points in the code you WILL see references to serialnumbers.
      I left them in so the proper positions and structure offsets aren't lost.

 - Y2K check:
 - Fixed bug in "quoted" modem strings... the quotes were sent too ;-)
   (reported by Oliver Kopp)

1.98.06+ (GPL preparations) 16 Aug 1998 =======================================

   Xenia: Fixed dayofweek problem after 1 Mar 2000.
   Xenia/XenEdit: Cleaned up some 2-digit year prints, whenever that was
                  possible without killing formats.
   XenEdit: Cleaned up some year nasties in hudson, rbbs.

1.98.06+ (reg.only, fix/beta) 20 May 1996 =====================================

 - Start of Xenia/NT port. Well, port... most code just compiled cleanly.
   I just haven't got the windowing and async stuff sorted out, so I can't
   give you a functional EXE yet.
   HEALTH WARNING: Don't you DARE nag me about Xenia/NT unless you are an
   experienced Windows/NT programmer who can help me with the win/async code!
   (and by 'help' I mean actual writing of code, not just providing info.)

 - Fixed the remaining glitches in the period scheduler (from the .05+ alpha).
   And some other minor stuff.

 - EXTREQ statements can now take upto three of the famous %.0u to include the
   task number in the command line....

 - Commandline POLL statement now also allows polls to point-addresses.

 - Detection of orphan point .0 files, ie. things for .0 in a .PNT directory.
   For instance XenObm creates stuff like that if you poll a node with .0
   XenObm problem, but just to make sure I've added protection to Xenia....

 - Similar to above orphan story, some prog created a .D$0 which Xenia through
   some internal logic interpreted as a DLO/DUT file and started calling....
   Fixed.

 - New fax options:
   FAX PADEOL   Makes Xenia pad a fax page with EOL codes; for some view utils.
   FAX NOPADEOL The opposite, of course; this is also the default. No padding.
   FAX RAW      Select RAW fax format instead of QFX or ZFAX.
                With this option, Xenia will create a XENIAnnn.001 for the
                first page, XENIAnnn.002 for the second page, and so on.

 - LOCALNETFILE <path>
   Similar to safenetfile (passworded sessions) but LOCALNETFILE is where PKTs
   to yourself are put, like fax receive notifications. Many mailprocessors
   require this, as they don't see passworded quite the same as fully secure.
   The LOCALNETFILE setting defaults to the same path as SAFENETFILE.

1.98.05+ (restricted alpha for PERIOD scheduler) 06 April 1996 ================

 - Time on statusbar not updated during Hydra session.
   Prob created while adding the chat code. Fixed.

 - Outgoing FreePoll sometimes didn't work.
   Prob caused while adding 'MDMRSP BADCALL'. Fixed.

 - *Receiving* long filenames (OS/2 only) via Hydra didn't work. Should now.

 - DIAL statement extended with patterns! New format:
   DIAL [start] [prefix]/[suffix] [address/telnr-pattern/nodelistflags ...]
   I added this because of English ISDN implementation, where international
   ISDN data calls need to be prefixed with 000, analog calls just with 00.
   If you have an ISDN card/adapter that does both analog and ISDN, there
   is no other nice way to do it (like with prefixsuffix statements, etc).

 - Period scheduler first put to use....
   See the new XENPER.CFG for info about configuring the period scheduler.
   Various config statements will be changed to use period tags.
   INCLUDE XENPER.CFG somewhere near the start of your XENIA.CFG because
   other statements will need to use the defined period tags.....
   General rules for this:
   Multiple period tags may be specified, separated by | or + chars.
   The function is active whenever at least one period is active.
   For some functions use of period tags is optional; if no tags are
   specified then, that function will always be active.
   If no periods at all have been configured, everything is also active.

 - Event B flag (BBS) removed, changed to period logic:
     EXTAPP   <type>[,<pertags>] ...
     DIALBACK <type>[,<pertags>] ...
   This means you can control each individual extapp!
   So now could even have different BBS apps for different times ;-)
   Temporary note: the 'time to next event' parm to extapp applications
   does not work at the moment; it will always say 1440 mins (=24 hrs).
   NOTE: make sure you remove the B flag from all your events!!!

 - Changed syntax for MAILHOUR statement, now uses periods:
   MAILHOUR <zone> <pertags>
   Using the predefined periods in XENPER.CFG, change XENSYS.CFG to this:
   MAILHOUR 1 Z1MH      ; Very simple, Z1MH upto Z6MH are defined periods!
   MAILHOUR 2 Z2MH
   MAILHOUR 3 Z3MH
   MAILHOUR 4 Z4MH
   MAILHOUR 5 Z5MH
   MAILHOUR 6 Z6MH

1.98.04+ (reg.only, fix/beta) 09 March 1996 ===================================

 - Sources released of: REQCOMP, XENSYNC, FAXSWAP.
   (NodeIDX was already available).

 - Hydra Chat facility!
   Press Alt-C to enable/disable your own keyboard.
   The special chat window will pop up too if the other end types something
   (you still have to press Alt-C before typing then!)
   It IS secure (won't keep the line open in case you are not actively
   chatting), and the remote can't beep you.
   Xenia will beep if you press Alt-C while chat is not available for any
   reason (too early/late in the session, no chat facility on other end, etc).
   You may move the chat window around the screen by using the cursor keys!

 - Day-of-week displayed wrong in some (local only) places.
   Think it started 6 Feb 1995 (which is a Wednesday, not a Thursday).
   Most curious that it didn't show up before. Quirk of months/weekdays...

 - Found & fixed 'Txy' nodelist flag old time-calculation bug (Xenia/DOS only).

 - Not possible to select the last few entries in the outbound window. Fixed.

 - VERBOSE_OUTBOUND keyword removed; with the 'shared' outbound queue, it was
   only affecting the look of the outbound window anyway, nothing else.
   Now it always works verbose...

 - Removed support for old The-Box base-36 outbound naming.

 - File sharing code (open function mostly) slightly changed.

 - File transfer receive management code slightly changed.
   May solve the spurious trap 0d under OS/2 in some Zmodem/Hydra receives.

 - Added base code of the new period scheduler.

 - Added X option to old event scheduler: don't send outbound requests.

 - Statistics (Stats/Moved window) written to logfile before reset at midnight.
   The log messages have a % identifier. Check it out... upon popular request!

 - Mailsession window now shows time session started.

 - Last in/bbs/out status fields now also show hh:mm.

 - Support for long filenames (OS/2 version) in Zmodem and Hydra now completed.
   No full paths transmitted, just long filenames.
   Please note that Xenia follows the Hydra specs to the letter:
       The first filename field [...] must conform to MS-DOS filename
       conventions and not exceed 12 characters in length [...].
       The second field, real filename, is the actual filename on the sending
       system. If this field is not present, the short filename field is used.
   So Xenia/2 places the long filename in the second field. If another program
   claiming long filename support does not receive long filenames from Xenia/2,
   tell the author of that program to read the specs and fix his/her stuff!
   The Hydra specs are fairly simple and quite clear on the subject....

 - CallerID detection for Supra 288 added "NMBR = ...."

 - Internal support for CONNECT 128K as used by ZyXEL Elite 2864I.
   (well you could get it done already with "MDMRSP 128000 CONNECT 128K")

 - Added MDMRSP BADCALL type; for no carrier calls that DID cost something.
   Will report "$ ... Charged no connect!" and note as failed session.

 - Fixed timing problem in new RINGS function.

 - Mistake with my OS/2 com routines rectified.
   May solve the EMSI SEND problem some people experienced...

 - Added some additional code to my OS/2 com routines.
   PCB/2 now definitly works on modem ports!
   On cFos/2 ports there still appear to be some probs. Please report on this!

 - Added option 'MAILER NO-SETDCB' (OS/2 only), which prevents Xenia from
   changing all but the bare essentials of the Device Control Block of the
   comport. This solves the problem with com drivers other than COM/SIO/CFOS,
   for instance the COM drivers for DigiBoards (was tested on such systems).
   IMPORTANT: Only use if absolutely necessary!!

 - Internal comport routines (OS/2 only) now open the port in DENYNONE instead
   of DENYALL mode. This is not entirely as it should be, because under OS/2
   one is supposed to pass a handle to other apps, not open the comport again.
   But some programs such as PPP can now be called from Xenia... which is nice.

 - Xenia/2 now tries to create a semaphore \SEM32\XENIAn (n = task number),
   and reports an error if this fails. Not to be difficult, but for your
   own safety. All kinds of rather nasty things could otherwise happen,
   especially with the above change for the comport open in shared mode....
   The semaphore will exist as long as the Xenia task is running; so you could
   even use it in a prog or rexx script to check whether tasks are up or not.

 - EMSI_ADDRESSES default setting changed. Used to be 1, now all configured.
   If EMSI_ADDRESSES IS specified in your config, this change of course has
   no impact on your setup.

 - Password login for EXTAPP should now work.

 - Internal request processor now checks for carrier.

 - Path probs with SRIF fixed.

 - PHONE statement will now also allow for \, inside phone#, instead of
   seeing it as separator for the nodelist flags...

 - SPEED [LOCK] <speed> [<divisor>]
   Optional <divisor> parameter added, for use with clock-doubling comports.
   These comports allow speeds higher than 115200.
   The default divisor is 1, of course; for normal comports.
   If your comport card runs a 2x clock, use divisor 2. For 3x, use 3.. etc.
   Xenia then takes <speed> as the TRUE speed, and uses <divisor> to calculate
   the speed at which the comport should be set. So you *see* the TRUE speed!
   Use this feature with caution, as for instance your BBS software or doors
   may get confused by speeds like 230400 or 460800 ;-)

 - RINGAPP <prgname> [<parameters>]
   Before sending answer string, call this application (voice answering apps).
   It is a direct execute call, no command processor; otherwise passing back an
   errorlevel does not always work.
   In addition to the user-specified parameters, Xenia adds some parameters to
   the end of the commandline: task comport devicename comhandle comspeed
   This is identical to the first 5 parameters in an EXTAPP application.
   The 'ring application' should pass back an errorlevel to Xenia:
   If errorlevel == 0, Xenia will still send its answer string etc.
   If errorlevel <> 0, Xenia will just init the modem and wait for next call.

 - XenEdit now automatically maintains a backup file while you're writing msgs!
   Filename: XENEDIT.BAK in the XenEdit home directory.
   The first backup is made 60 seconds after editing starts, and then every
   60 seconds or when major things happen (like text import etc).
   It can also be forced with Alt-W, or by defining an EDIT_KEY for 'backup'.
   NOTE: the initial 60 second delay gives you the chance to import an old BAK
   file (for instance if you had a powercut and want to start again).
   On normal exit of the msg edit routine the BAK file is wiped for crypto
   security.... during editing, an old BAK is wiped after a new one is written.

 - REQCOMP now uses the 'MAILER' environment variable to find REQUEST.CFG

1.98.03+ (reg.only, fix/beta) 23 October 1995 =================================

 - Xenia no longer loads/uses COMCAPI for normal comports.
   I've done some tests: my own code eats just as little CPU time, and is just
   as fast if not a little faster (well, a layer less is always faster eh ;-)
   COMCAPI is still loaded/used if a 'PORT CAPI' is specified in the config.
   However, the author of COMCAPI, Michael Buenter, says that his CAPI code is
   still far from perfect. So if you have any trouble with it, just use cFos/2.

 - EMSI problem with CrossPoint fixed!

 - XENAP*.BAT/CMD and XENID*.BAT/CMD now written in home path, not current dir.
   Safer; but make sure your own batchfiles take this into account.

 - NodeIDX 1.07 allows for a duplicate zone/region/net if there are no nodes
   entries in the previously encountered segment. This should fix most trouble.

1.98.02+ (not released) =======================================================

 - Snoop problem 'Can't load/query SNSRV_32.DLL' fixed.

 - If a multiline-registered Xenia would be started without task number,
   it would trap. Fixed.

 - XMEXIT.n containing an errorlevel wouldn't work (always 0). Fixed.

 - Bug with writing SRIF file (for external request processor). Fixed.

 - Little bug in nodelist lookup for points. Fixed.

 - Xenia sometimes refused to call ('d' call disallowed by OKDIAL line). Fixed.

 - Xenia now reports 'YooHoo/EMSI SEND: Carrier lost (password failure?)'
   instead of just 'Carrier lost'. Xenia has no way of knowing the reason for
   the carrier loss, so the 'password failure' is just a guess.... may help.

 - Changed filesharing logic, partly to compensate for LANtastic/DOS stupidity.
   For a program that supports SHARE.EXE-functionality, it's downright silly
   to not respond positively to the appropriate DOS call for checking whether
   sharing is okay. All other LAN-brands I know of do this just fine. Idiotic.

 - XenEdit problem (trap) with username-lookup fixed.
   Also some mishap with deleting users from the userlist.... fixed.

1.98.01+ (reg.only, fix/beta) 10 October 1995 =================================

 - Xenia will no long run without a task number, even for a single line node.
   Things were getting very messy indeed. Now, if you don't specify a task
   number, you'll be assigned task 1. This also applies to utilities like
   XenSync; all external semaphores and data files will ALWAYS get number now.
   The 1.98 sample configs already set tasknumber 1 so everybody should be ok.
   Of course, what task numbers you can define depends on your registration.

 - OS/2 kill signal (Window Close command) is still intercepted by Xenia, but
   the signal handler now resets to default after the first signal.
   This means that if the program actually does hang for some reason, you CAN
   now really close the window by just doing Window Close for a second time.
   Ye; suddenly thought of this possibility, and wondered whether it'd work.
   Well, it does ;-)  Seems like an absolutely perfect solution, eh?

 - OS/2 version now automatically uses SHARE / SHAREPORT option.

 - OS/2 version now only loads AGLWIN2.DLL and COMCAPI.DLL, all other DLLs
   are only loaded if and when they are used. Saves on memory.....

 - DOS version problem with LANtastic 'server ...' error fixed.

 - Probable other 'abort/retry/fail' LANtastic msg on flag at startup fixed.

 - scan_semaphore was counting in 10ths of seconds instead of seconds. Fixed.
   This may have been the cause of the heavy network load some people
   experienced.

 - Session password max.length changed from 8 to 39 for EMSI, fully checked.

 - Can specify spaces in appkey cmd string by using underscore (_).

 - Can specify spaces in modem strings and phone numbers using underscore (_).

 - ZyXEL Elite 2864I ISDN/modem CallerID support added.

 - External fax receive wasn't possible... Xenia dropped carrier somewhere.

 - Partial FAXes saved: if a session failed, you do keep all completed pages.

 - Changed FAX timing.

 - FAX QFX
   Selects writing received faxes in Quicklink II's .QFX format.
   The default is ZyXEL's ZFAX format (also selectable with 'FAX ZFAX').
   FAXSWAP/FAXSWAP2 have been updated to be able to bitswap .QFX files too.

 - ZMODEM_TXWINDOW <bytes>
   option added; works similar to HYDRA_TXWINDOW option. Use only when
   necessary, like on VMODEM/TELNET links over Internet, with a heavy
   line delay. It IS compatible with any Zmodem receiver, all within specs.
   Still, Hydra is faster and also more reliable on these kinds of links.....

 - Improved support for TCP/IP links (like via VMODEM); timing adjustments.
   Most are handled by Xenia automatically, but some config statements help.
   Xenia can now handle Telnet/Vmodem links without any timeouts/errors!
   Here's a sample 'VMODEM.CFG' modem config for Xenia.
     ; Some phone overrides for TCP/IPable systems
     PHONE 1:396/1    sstar.com,CM,TELNET
     PHONE 1:270/101  bbs.paonline.com,CM,TELNET
     PHONE 1:203/7077 gigo.com,CM,VMODEM,TELNET
     ; Linespeed adjustments for Telnet/Vmodem connects.
     ; No the line isn't 2400 bps, but the speed/delays probably will be.
     ; So the timing need to take that into account, otherwise: trouble.
     MDMRSP 2400 CONNECT 57600/ARQ/TEL
     MDMRSP 2400 CONNECT 57600/ARQ/VMP
     ; Limit the runahead; doesn't really slow down, just improves reliability.
     ; Do NOT use these parms on normal modem/ISDN lines, that WILL slow down!
     HYDRA_TXWINDOW  16384
     HYDRA_RXWINDOW  16384
     ZMODEM_TXWINDOW 16384
     ; Some modem config strings
     OKDIAL VMODEM TELNET -*
     PREFIXSUFFIX ATDT"#/"|          VMODEM
     PREFIXSUFFIX ATDT"/"|           TELNET
     PREFIXSUFFIX ATDT"/"|

 - Buffering of statuslog and timelog changed, you should now always be able
   to read upto the last line from disk.
   Logfiles are opened 'shared, deny-write', so any other application that
   also opens in shared mode will be able to read the file also. So if your
   LIST or log analyser util won't open the file, its really the util's fault.

 - Outbound scanning optimized for multi node operation and outbound manager.
   Be sure to touch XMRESCAN.FLG after running your mailprocessor or outbound
   manager! Something like REM.>C:\XENIA\IPC\XMRESCAN.FLG

 - Added 'mailer no-dirscan' option to switch off outbound directory scanning
   for specific tasks. Make sure you leave it enabled in at least ONE task! ;-)

 - Manually select preferred node to call next (set to top of outbound window).

 - Some cosmetic problems with the outbound window fixed.

 - Added $ option to events, like Z: Z kills all no-connect retry counters,
   while $ will kill the counters of failed connects... use with caution!

 - All semaphores, MAILPROCESS, etc now also work if you only have 1 task.

 - Xenia will no longer call itself. Works just like an OKDIAL -... with your
   akas (but only upto the number specified in emsi_addresses!).

 - RINGS <n>
   Specify number of rings before answering. Default is 2.
   This statement obsoletes the 'FIRSTRING' option.

 - MDMRSP option IGNORE
   Tells Xenia to just ignore that particular response, and get another line.
   Xenia itself uses it for 'CONNECT FAX' and 'FAX' if 'FAX OFF' is specified,
   and for 'DATA' unless the USR specific 'DATA <commandstring>' is specified.

 - New commandline option 'ANSWER' tells Xenia to not toggle DTR, not init
   the modem, but immediately answer phone. Used for VMODEMD (see below).

 - Mult. PHONE entries for one node now individually aware of CM/Txy flags etc.

 - Statistics (Stats/Moved window) automatically reset each day after midnight.

 - XENIA*.EVT file can be changed while Xenia task is still running.
   You'll still have to exit/start to have Xenia read in the new one, but at
   least it'll recognize that your event file has changed then.
   It's a matter of timestamps...

 - XENIA*.BAN file read when needed instead of at startup. Is more flexible.

 - Changed YooHoo and other timing during Vmodem/Telnet sessions.

 - Domain name was sent with leading @ in YooHoo; fixed.

 - Long domain name sent in EMSI instead of abbreviation; makes Bink happy.

 - Diskspace >4GB no longer causes 'not enough diskspace' messages

 - MCP <pipebase> <maxtasks>
   Support for Maximus 3.00 Master Control Program
   Examples: MCP \pipe\maximus\mcp 10
             MCP \\myserver\pipe\maximus\mcp 10

 - Added 'mailer no-directzap' option.

 - REQCOMP: bug in :LATEST handling fixed.

 - Duplicate requests handling improved; a file will only be sent once.

 - SRIF (Standard Request Inferface) external request processor support.
   EXTREQ <prgname>

 - Engineered away the 64KB limit of REQUEST.IDX in the DOS version of Xenia.
   Should make happy the sysops of systems with large file bases....
   Request processsing may be slightly slower now, but not very much.

 - XMHANGUP.n (failure to hangup) semaphore now deleted on startup of task(=n).

 - SHUTDOWN.## renamed to XMEXIT.n (n=task), may contain errorlevel in ASCII.
   So you can now use 'ECHO 200 >XMEXIT.9' to have Xenia task 9 exit with
   errorlevel 200. Simple solution, isn't it? No hex codes to calculate.

 - MAILFLAG.## renamed to XMMAILIN.n (n=task in decimal or nothing if no task#)

 - Outbound requests now only deleted at end of succesful session.

 - 'mailer no-pwforce' option to disable checking of other end's password on
   outgoing calls.

 - Fixed logic error: on outgoing calls, if password was sent but none
   received, Xenia should (without mailer no-pwforce) option declare a
   password security violation, and cut off the session.

 - Added EMSI password exchange using 'shared secret' encryption with MD5.

 - EXTAPP ... <string>[,[<password>]] ...
   Optional password. This implies CR required atfer <string>
   If ',' present but no <password>, just require CR after <string>
   If <password> is "*" (sans quotes) password is required but not checked.
 - CALLBACK ... <string>[,[<password>]]
   Extended in same way as EXTAPP
 - LOGINPROMPT <string>
   Enables login prompting and echo.
   \r=cr, \n=lf, \s=space, \\=\
   Sample: LOGINPROMPT \r\n\r\nLogin:\s

 * FreePoll<tm> agl 1994-1995
 - FREEPOLL_DIAL <address> [<address> ...]
   Address to try and use freepoll when dialling out
   Sample FREEPOLL_DIAL 2:283/550
 - FREEPOLL_PATTERN <pattern>
   Response pattern to identify freepoll when dialling out
   Sample: FREEPOLL *Call rejected*     ; CAUSE=34be as decoded by XENCAUSE.CFG
 - FREEPOLL_ANSWER <address>,<callerid>[,minKB] ...
   Address+callerid(+minKB) to try and use freepoll when answering
   Sample FREEPOLL_ANSWER 2:283/550,*33653078,100
 - REJECT <modem command string>
   Sample: REJECT ATH1|                 ; works for cFos(/2)

 - CallerID/CLIP catching (with Caller-ID capable modem line, ISDN, or VMODEM)
   If a file named XENIA.CLI exists in Xenia's home directory, CallerIDs will
   be matched with calling nodes (mailsessions) and users (only when using the
   'BBS' option, currently only for Maximus and RA), and that info is stored.
   So next time there's an incoming call with that CallerID, Xenia will look
   up print and print the stored information. Could be useful for tracking
   problems, or just for fun.
   For BBSuser calls, Xenia will create a file name XENID*.BAT/.CMD (where * is
   the task number) with the following line: 'SET XENCLI_USERNAME=John Doe'
   Use is simple: in the batchfile that starts your BBS you do CALL XENID*.BAT,
   and with for instance Maximus you can then pass the username with the -j
   parameter: "-j%XENCLI_USERNAME%" (with the double quotes!)
   Result: Maximus will already know the user's name! Users mostly respond very
   positively to this trick....
   If you don't want a CallerID to be sent sent on to the BBS, just edit the
   XENIA.CLI file: delete everything after the CallerID, and add ',ignore'.
   This could be necessary if multiple users call from the same phone/IPnumber.

 - Xenia now accepts a 'port NONE' to run a task with no comport.
   Typically used for FTPMAIL, or to run the outbound scan on a server.
   Note: such a task still requires a task number!

 - FTPMAIL <z:n/n[.p]> <site> <userid> [<passwd>]
   OS/2 TCP/IP: FTP mail client - 'dial' using FTP (TCP/IP) instead of normal
   mailsession. Applies to outgoing calls only.

 - OS/2 TCP/IP: VMODEMD.EXE (Vmodem daemon) can be used to start Xenia tasks
   on demand for incoming Vmodem and Telnet connections. Kinda like an INETD
   for Vmodem calls (VMODEMD.EXE responds to the semaphores set by VMODEM.EXE).
   Setup/usage examples included in VMODEM.CFG

 - SCRIPT <tag> <send> [<expect> <send> <expect> <send> <expect> ...]
   Script definitions
   A script may be defined over multiple lines, just use the same tag and the
   additional lines will be appended with a space inbetween.
   The scripting uses the well known UUCP format with send/expect strings,
   and supports \Wnn timeout overrides as well as most \escaping options.
   A script is a list of send and expect strings, with optional special codes.
   The strings are separated by a space char, and first string is for send.
     \escapes on SEND strings in alphabetical order (NOTE: CASE SENSITIVE!)
        \EOT    Send EOT (end of text) char (ASCII 4)
        \BREAK  Send break signal
        \\      Send backslash (\) char
        \b      Send BS (backspace) char (ASCII 8)
        \c      Do *not* send CR (ASCII 13) after string (normally one IS sent)
        \d      Delay for 2 seconds
        \K      Send break signal
        \L      Send login name (if there is one)
        \n      Send LF (linefeed) char (ASCII 10)
        \N      Send NUL char (ASCII 0)
        \p      Delay for half a second
        \P      Send login password (if there is one)
        \r      Send CR (carriage return) char (ASCII 13)
                Note that by default, Xenia already adds CR after a send string
        \s      Send SP (space) char (ASCII 32)
        \t      Send HT (tab) char (ASCII 9)
        \ooo    Send char ooo octal
        \xHH    Send char HH hex
        All other chars are sent as-is.
     \escapes on EXPECT strings in alphabetical order (NOTE: CASE SENSITIVE!)
        \b      Expect BS (backspace) char (ASCII 8)
        \n      Expect LF (linefeed) char (ASCII 10)
        \N      Expect NUL char (ASCII 0)
        \r      Expect CR (carriage return) char (ASCII 13)
        \s      Expect SP (space) char (ASCII 32)
        \t      Expect HT (tab) char (ASCII 9)
        \ooo    Expect char ooo octal
        \xHH    Expect char HH hex
        All other chars are expected as-is.
        \Wnn    The default wait timeout on an EXPECT string is 10 seconds.
                You may change this timeout for the current string by adding
                \Wnn to the end of the string, where nn is the required delay
                in seconds.
     Normally, a timeout causes the script to fail (ie. Xenia aborts).
     You can get around this by using so-called sub-expect strings:
        ogin:~2-\c\r\d\d\r-ogin:~15-\c\r\d\d\r-ogin:
     From the example above: if the string 'oring:' doesn't arrive within
     2 seconds, a CR is sent, 4 seconds delay, another CR, and then go on
     to wait for 'ogin:' again. So you put SEND strings inside EXPECT strings.
     They are separated by a dash character (-). If the expected string IS
     (finally) received, the rest of the sub-expect stuff is skipped.

 - COLOUR SCRIPT ... <same parameters as for COLOURS FILE>

 - TERMSCRIPT <tag>[,<loginname>[,<password>]] <address>|<phone#> [...]
   Use scripts in terminal mode for the specified address/phone# patterns.
   Scripts take precedence over IEMSI.
   Underscore in <loginname> will be replaced by space.

 - MAILSCRIPT <tag>[,<loginname>[,<password>]] <address>|<phone#> [...]
   Using scripts in (FidoNet-tech) mailer mode; started right after the
   dialler gets CONNECT, before calling the normal mailsession handler.
   Underscore in <loginname> will be replaced by space.

 - Xenia Edit: config reading upgraded for GEcho 1.20

 - NODEIDX: new statement 'UserList' added to NODEIDX.CFG
   With this is used, XenEdit can look up names/addresses from all nodelists.
   The normal pattern matching works; and even though it's a sequential scan,
   it seems to be quite fast enough.
   If this works ok, I'll add the 'lookup by name' to Xenia Mailer as well.
