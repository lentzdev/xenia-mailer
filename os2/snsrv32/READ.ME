this dll allows 32b os/2 programs to access the 16 snserver.dll
without needing any thunking.

it's only possible to access _one_ snoop server per process
because there's only on callback function available.

snsrvX32.dll   subsystem version - rename to snsrv_32.dll
snsrv_32.dll   normal version

both versions seem to run reasonably well.
